    `Welcome to the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Student Chapter at San Diego State University!

    <br /><br />

    The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), founded in 1947, is an international scientific and educational organization
    dedicated to advancing the art, science, engineering, and application of information technology, serving both professional
    and public interests by fostering the open interchange of information and by promoting the highest professional and ethical standards.

    <br /><br />

    The ACM Chapter at SDSU is run by STEM undergraduates at San Diego State University. We are a group of students who are
    passionate about computing and technology. We are dedicated to providing our members with opportunities to learn about
    the latest technologies, network with professionals, and develop their skills.
    Socials and formals will also be a part of our club here at SDSU. We plan to take trips to computing-related locations
    such as the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC), and plan on being active members of our community, fostering and
    encouraging young people to join high-tech careers by giving tours of SDSU to high school students, among many other activities.

    <br /><br />

    The ACM Student Chapter at SDSU (ACM@SDSU) is open to ALL students and faculty at San Diego State University.`
