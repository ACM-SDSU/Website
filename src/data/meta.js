    description: `Welcome to the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Student Chapter at San Diego State University!
    <br /><br />
    The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), founded in 1947, is an international scientific and educational organization dedicated to advancing the art, science, engineering, and application of information technology, serving both professional and public interests by fostering the open interchange of information and by promoting the highest professional and ethical standards.
    <br /><br />
    The San Diego State University student chapter of the ACM is run by STEM undergraduates at San Diego State University. We plan to hold many workshops and tutoring sessions to help students with their schooling and curiosity of computers. Socials and formals will also be a part of our club here at SDSU. We plan to take trips to computing-related locations such as the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC), and plan on being active members of our community, fostering and encouraging young people to join high-tech careers by giving tours of SDSU to high school students, among many other activities.
    <br /><br />
    The ACM Student Chapter at SDSU (ACM@SDSU) is open to ALL students at San Diego State University.`
